        "The essence of Gradient Descent is to minimize a function, typically a loss function \\( F(w) \\) in machine learning, by iteratively adjusting the variables (often weights in machine learning) involved. The algorithm uses the gradient, or the \"direction of steepest ascent,\" to inform how these variables should be adjusted. By moving in the opposite direction—i.e., the \"direction of steepest descent\"—we can find the minimum of the function. The learning rate, often denoted as \\( \\eta \\) or \\( \\alpha \\), controls the size of these steps.\n",

        "1. **Initialization**: Choose an initial set of weights \\( w(0) \\).\n",

        "2. **Iteration**: For each iteration \\( n \\), execute the following:\n",
        "    - **Compute Loss**: Evaluate \\( F(w) \\) using the current set of weights \\( w(n) \\).\n",
        "    - **Calculate Gradient**: Compute the gradient \\( \\nabla F(w) \\), which gives the direction of the \"steepest ascent\" of the function at \\( w(n) \\).\n",

        "The number of samples $N$ and the number of features $D+1$ play a vital role in how well a multivariate linear regression model performs, particularly when you're worried about overfitting. Here's a quick rundown:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Less Samples than Features ($N < D+1$)**\n",
        "  - In this tricky situation, the matrix $X^T X$ isn't invertible. This happens because you've got more unknowns than equations, leaving you with an underdetermined system. Your options are limited: you can either reduce the number of features or introduce regularization methods to make the matrix invertible.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Slightly More Samples than Features ($N \\approx D+1$)**\n",
        "  - Okay, so here the matrix $X^T X$ is invertible, but it's not time to celebrate just yet. Your model might get too cozy with the noise in the data, picking up random fluctuations instead of the real trend. The result? It might do great on the training data but stumble when it sees new, unseen data. To handle this, you could use regularization techniques like Ridge or Lasso.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Significantly More Samples than Features ($N \\gg D+1$)**\n",
        "  - Now you're talking! In this case, the matrix $X^T X$ is happily invertible, and the risk of overfitting drops. With a heap of data at your disposal, your model can do a much better job capturing the underlying trends, setting you up for success on new data.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Increasing the Number of Samples**\n",
        "  - If you're still wringing your hands about overfitting, there's a simple fix—just add more samples to the training set. This beefs up your model's understanding of the underlying data distribution and helps it generalize better to new, out-of-sample data.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, the balance between your number of samples and features is crucial for your model's performance, particularly when overfitting is on the radar."
