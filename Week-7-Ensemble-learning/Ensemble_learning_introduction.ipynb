        "- **Understanding**: We want you to get a clear idea of what ensemble learning is and why it's useful.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Types of Ensembles**: We'll explore two main types:\n",
        "  - **Homogeneous Ensembles**: Here, we use the same type of model multiple times. Examples include **bagging** **random forests** and **boosting**.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Heterogeneous Ensembles**: This involves using different types of models together. We'll touch on this briefly.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Sequential vs. Parallel Methods**: We'll differentiate between these two. Sequential methods build on the previous model's output, whereas parallel methods operate concurrently, aiming to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Practical Work**: We'll build a Bagging model using decision trees. If you missed our last session, don't worry; there's a ready-to-use code module for you.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Using Scikit-Learn**: We'll practice implementing our learned methods using this popular tool.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of the week, you should:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Know what ensemble learning is and its benefits.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Understand the difference between bagging, boosting, and other methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Be able to create a basic Bagging model.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Know how to use these methods in Scikit-Learn.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Have a basic idea about stacking (another ensemble method)."
