    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Data: Brain MRI**\n",
    "   - An MRI scan of the brain contains voxel intensities. Each voxel (a 3D pixel) has an intensity value that represents a specific tissue type.\n",
    "   - If you were to plot the distribution of these intensities, you might notice distinct peaks or clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Brainmasking and Observing Peaks:**\n",
    "   - Brainmasking is a preprocessing step where only the brain region is considered, and other parts are set to zero. This helps in removing non-brain elements.\n",
    "   - Once this is done, if you look at the histogram of intensities, you might notice three clear peaks. These peaks typically correspond to:\n",

    "   - GMM will consider these peaks in the histogram as arising from different Gaussian distributions. It will try to fit multiple Gaussian curves to these peaks.\n",
    "   - The main goal of GMM is to identify parameters (like mean and standard deviation) for each Gaussian distribution (each tissue type in our case).\n",
    "   - Once GMM has these parameters, it can tell us the probability of a voxel belonging to white matter, grey matter, or CSF based on its intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Processing the MRI Data:**\n",
    "   - For each voxel in the MRI data, GMM will evaluate its intensity and assign it to one of the Gaussian distributions (or tissue types) based on the highest probability.\n",
    "   - Remember the parts outside the brain that were padded with zeros after brainmasking? GMM will essentially ignore these because they don't belong to any of the identified Gaussian distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Outcome:**\n",
    "   - After processing, GMM will provide segmented regions of the brain MRI, clearly demarcating areas of white matter, grey matter, and CSF.\n",

    "**1. Using Gaussian Distributions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "When we talk about representing the intensity distribution for each cluster (or category) using a Gaussian distribution, think of it like this: Imagine a **bell curve**. The top or peak of the curve represents the **most common** intensity for that group, and as we move away from the peak, the intensities become **less common**.\n",
    "\n",

    "**2. Likelihood of Observing an Intensity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when we see a certain **intensity, $x_i$**, in an image, we can use our bell curve to check how likely it is that this **intensity belongs to a group $k$**. The formula for this is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(x_i|y_i=k,\\mu_k, \\sigma_k ) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma}} e^{\\frac{-(x_i-\\mu_k)^2}{2\\sigma_k^2}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula might look a bit intimidating, but it's just a mathematical way to describe our bell curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Mixture of Gaussians:**\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if our image has multiple groups of colors? This is where the idea of a mixture of Gaussians comes in. Instead of just one bell curve, we'll have several, **each representing a different group of intensities**. Each bell curve gets a **weight**, called the **mixing coefficient ($c_k$)**, based on how dominant that group is in the image. We combine all these bell curves to get the overall distribution of intensities in the image:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(x|\\Phi) = \\sum_{k} c_k G_{\\sigma_k} (x−\\mu_k)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Parameters for Each Gaussian:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, for every bell curve (or Gaussian) we use, it's described by its center ($\\mu_k$), spread ($\\sigma_k$), and weight ($c_k$). We collectively represent all these parameters for all the bell curves as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Phi = (\\mu_k, \\sigma_k, c_k)_{k=1,\\ldots,K}$$.\n",

What we want to do with the GMM is find the **best mix** – the best set of means, standard deviations, and mixing proportions – that **describes these intensities**. This is a bit like trying to find the perfect recipe that brings out all the flavors in a dish.\n",

    "To do this, we aim to **maximize** something called the **log-likelihood** of the image given our GMM parameters, denoted as $\\phi$. In simpler terms, we're trying to find the best fit for our model to the data. Now, here's a neat thing: if we assume that each tiny unit (or voxel) in the image is independent, we can sum up the individual contributions of each voxel to get the overall goodness of fit. And that's where our **mix of Gaussian distributions** comes into play.\n",

    "### Candy Analogy for Gaussian Mixture model\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a colorful bag of candies. Each candy represents a data point (or intensity in our case), and they come in different flavors. Now, you want to group these candies based on their flavors, but you're not entirely sure how many flavors there are or what each flavor tastes like. That's where the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) steps in. It helps us find these hidden \"flavors\" (or clusters) in our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make things even cooler, GMM doesn't just say, \"Hey, this candy belongs to this flavor!\" Instead, it tells us the probability or chance that a candy belongs to each flavor. So, for a given candy, it might say there's an 80% chance it's apple-flavored and a 20% chance it's orange-flavored. This is what we call **probabilistic segmentation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire game is about finding the best way to describe our candies using these groups or clusters. This is achieved using certain parameters, collectively called **Ф (Phi)**. Think of these parameters as the unique recipe for each flavor. The main ingredients of this recipe are:\n",
    "- The average taste of candies in a group (**μ**).\n",
    "- How varied the taste is within the group (**σ**).\n",
    "- The overall presence of that flavor in the entire bag (**c**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our mission is to find the best possible recipe for each flavor. But here's the thing: we don't just do it in one go. We keep tasting and adjusting until we're pretty sure we've got it right. This process of taste-test-adjust is what we call an **algorithm**. In this case, our algorithm is:\n",
    "1. Make a guess about the flavors and their recipes.\n",
    "2. Based on that guess, see how likely each candy is to belong to each flavor.\n",
    "3. Refine our guess based on the candies' responses.\n",
    "4. Repeat until our guess doesn't change much anymore (or in fancy terms, until the **log-likelihood** converges).\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, our tastings and adjustments are expressed by these formulas:\n",
    "- For the chance that a candy belongs to a flavor:\n",

    "So, you've got this vibrant collection of data points, like having a bag of assorted candies. These data points, similar to candies, have their unique characteristics, like different flavors. Our challenge? Grouping these points based on their similarities. Enter Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). It helps us identify these underlying groups in our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "But GMM adds a twist! Instead of just categorizing a data point into a group, it gives us the likelihood of it belonging to each group. For example, it might say a particular point has an 80% chance of being in Group A and 20% in Group B. This cool feature is known as **probabilistic segmentation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea is about best describing our data using these groups. We do this with certain parameters, known as $Ф$ (Phi). These parameters help define each group. They include:\n",
    "- The average characteristic of points in a group ($mu$).\n",
    "- The variability within the group ($sigma$).\n",
    "- The proportion of that group in the entire dataset ($c$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to pinpoint these parameters. But we don't do this randomly. It's a systematic process where we estimate, check, and refine. This iterative process is our **algorithm**. The steps are:\n",
    "1. Make an initial estimation of the groups and their characteristics.\n",
    "2. Based on that estimation, determine the likelihood of each data point belonging to each group.\n",
    "3. Tweak our initial guess based on the feedback.\n",
    "4. Keep refining until our estimates are consistent and reliable.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "- Getting the likelihood of a point belonging to a group, considering all the parameters:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(y_i = k | x_i, \\Phi) = \\frac{p(y_i = k | \\Phi) P(x_i | y_i = k, \\Phi)}{\\sum_k p(y_i = k | \\Phi) P(x_i | y_i = k, \\Phi)}\n",
