        "Feature extraction is the art of simplifying our data. Imagine you have a vast canvas with a sprawling and complex painting. Feature extraction is like being able to reproduce that painting on a smaller canvas, while still capturing its essence and beauty. When we dive deep into large datasets, especially those from signals or images, there's so much going on! There are tons of details, but not all of them are crucial. Feature extraction helps us filter out the noise and focus on the salient features, those significant brush strokes that truly define the artwork.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why is this important? Well, when we reduce the complexity of our data, we're setting ourselves up for success in the world of machine learning. A simplified, yet meaningful dataset is less prone to overfitting, where our model might get too caught up in the tiny details and miss the big picture. Furthermore, models trained on such data are not only more accurate but also learn faster.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, the next time you come across a large dataset, think of it as that vast canvas. Through feature extraction, you're not only making the canvas more manageable but ensuring that every brush stroke on it truly counts. By emphasizing the right details and sidelining the redundant ones, we create a perfect setting for our machine learning models to thrive.\n"

        "\n",
        "Now, these pictures can be a bit overwhelming. Every single detail of your heart is captured in these images. But, what if we just want to understand how your heart pumps blood? That's where \"feature extraction\" waltzes in like a detective, looking for clues about your heart's performance. It's like skimming a book to understand the main plot without getting bogged down by all the side stories.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, to help us understand these images, we use a smart tool called a **convolutional neural network**. Think of it as a set of virtual glasses that can highlight specific parts of the heart in these pictures.\n",
        "\n",
        "From these highlighted sections, we measure how much blood the left ventricle (an important chamber in the heart) holds and pumps out. It's a bit like observing how much water fills and empties from a water balloon.\n",
        "\n",
        "Two moments capture our attention: when the balloon is fully blown (end diastole) and when it's most squeezed out (end systole). With these two measurements, we can calculate something called the \"ejection fraction\" (EF). It's like finding out how much water the balloon pushes out in one go!\n",

        "Here's a simple formula:\n",

        "\n",
        "- **LVESV (Left Ventricular End-Systolic Volume)**: This is the amount of blood remaining in the left ventricle after it has contracted. It's the volume of the left ventricle when it's least full.\n",

        "The formula calculates the difference between the volume of blood in the left ventricle before and after it contracts. This difference is then divided by the full volume (before contraction) to get a fraction. Multiplying by 100 converts this fraction into a percentage, giving us the ejection fraction. This percentage helps in understanding how effectively the heart is pumping blood out during each beat."

        "To derive the QRS interval from an ECG signal, we start with processing the raw ECG. The first step involves filtering the signal to discard low-frequency drifts and any external noise. This gives us a cleaner waveform to work with. Next, we determine the peaks which appear as local highs and lows (maxima and minima) within the filtered signal. By setting certain thresholds, like a minimum height and distance between the peaks, we can accurately pinpoint the Q, R, and S peaks. After these peaks are detected, the next step is to compute the average duration of the QRS interval from the data gathered over the course of the ECG recording.\n",

First, you'd want to get rid of that noise. That's what we do with filtering; it helps us hear (or in this case, see) the main beats clearly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next up, we look for the high and low points in our 'song'. These are our peaks. But wait! Not every peak is the right beat we're looking for. So, we set some ground rules to pick out the main beats, which we call the Q, R, and S peaks.\n",
