They provide a visual representation where each decision made by the tree can be **seen and understood**. Each path from the tree's root to a leaf signifies a **specific rule**. For instance, an internal node in the tree making a decision based on the feature \"Age < 25\" is straightforward to comprehend.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Feature importance** is another area where decision trees shine. While the tree itself is **transparent**, its underlying mechanism offers valuable insights that can be used to **explain even more complex models**, like **random forests** or **gradient boosting machines**. In decision trees, the **importance** of a feature is often computed based on the **total reduction of a criterion**, such as the **Gini impurity or entropy**, brought about by that feature. A higher value indicates that the feature plays a more pivotal role in making decisions within the tree.\n",

Each coefficient indicates the change in the output for a unit change in that feature, assuming other features remain constant. However, the **simplicity of these coefficients is also their limitation**. They provide insights into linear relationships but **can't capture non-linear interactions between features**.\n",
        "\n",
        "**That's where decision trees fill the gap**. They, and by extension, **ensemble methods like random forests**, are adept at capturing non-linear relationships. The feature importance metrics from trees shed light on which features are most critical in decision-making, even in intricate, non-linear scenarios. By **juxtaposing the coefficients from linear models with the feature importance derived from decision trees**, one can obtain a nuanced understanding of the dataset. Linear models provide insights into the linear importance of each feature, while decision trees offer a broader perspective, encapsulating both linear and non-linear interactions.\n",

This gives us an F-value, which essentially tells us how likely it is that a feature's correlation with the target is just by chance. The good news? This F-value is closely tied to the Pearson’s coefficient.\n",

When utilizing `SelectKBest`, it requires two main inputs: a scoring function (in this context, `f_regression`) and the number of features we wish to select.\n",

The least important feature is then removed and the model is tested again. This process continues, with one feature being removed at a time, until we have a ranking of features from most to least important. By doing this, we can decide on the top features we want to keep. If we use tools like RFECV from sklearn, it can even automatically choose the best number of features for us. When we tried this with the Ridge regression model, it selected features 1 and 2 as the most important.\n",

Sometimes, when we use feature selection methods, they might end up choosing just one of these correlated features to represent the entire group. This can be a problem because some of those highly predictive features might not get the recognition they deserve, leading to lower importances for them.\n",

It's a method that helps transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving the essential relationships between data points.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Graph Laplacian:** Next, it computes a mathematical construct known as the \"Graph Laplacian.\" This construct captures how connected or isolated each data point is within the graph. It's a matrix that encodes the relationships between data points.\n",
